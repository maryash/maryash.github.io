HOMEWORK 1  
  
1-1
Find a method similar to the remainder method for the integer numbers that applies to fractional numbers -- as in converting: 0.379$$_{10}$$ = 0.???$$_2$$  
  
1-2
Consider the two decimal numbers:  
M = 3892.74  
N = 9341.65  
Convert them to bases 2 and 16, and then add & subtract them in those bases.  
  
1-A
Which is the largest binary number that can be expressed with 15 bits?  
What are the equivalent decimal and hexadecimal numbers?  
  
1-B
Consider a system that contains 32K bytes.  Assume that we are using byte addressing, that is each byte will need to have its own address, and therefore we will need 32K different addresses.  For convenience all addresses will have the same number n of bits, and n should be as small as possible.  
What is the value of n?  
  
1-C
The numbers in each of the following equalities are all expressed in the same base r.  Determine this radix (base) r in each case for the following operations to be correct:  
a) 14 / 2 = 5  
b) 54 / 4 = 13

HOMEWORK 2  
  
1 - 12  
Perform these binary multiplications:  
a) 1101 * 1011  
b) 0101 * 1010  
c) 100111 * 011011  
  
1 - 14  
A limited number system uses base 12.  There are at most four integer digits.  The weights of the digits are 12$$^3$$, 12$$^2$$, 12, and 1.  Special names are given to the weights of the digits as follows: 12 = 1 dozen, 12$$^2$$ = gross, and 12$$^3$$ = 1 great gross.  
a) How many beverage companies are in 6 great gross + 8 gross + 7 dozen + 4?  
b) Find the representation in base 12 for 7569$$_{10}$$ beverage cans.  
  
1 - 16  
In each of the following cases, determine the radix $$r$$:  
a) BEE$$_r$$ = 2699$$_{10}$$  
b) 365$$_r$$ = 194$$_{10}$$

HOMEWORK 3  
3 - 1  
Why does the 1s complement subtraction algorithm work?  
  
3 - A  
Do the following conversion problems:  
a) Convert decimal 34.4375 to binary.  
b) Calculate the binary equivalent of 1/3 to 8 binary places, enter the result, then, after converting back to decimal -- how close is it to 1/3?   
C) Convert the binary result of b) to hexadecimal and enter result. Then convert the hexadecimal decimal -- is the same as from binary?  
  
3 - B  
Determine the base $$X$$ if 211$$_x$$ = 152$$_8$$.  
  
3 - C  
Noting tha 3$$^2$$ = 9, formulate a procedure to convert from base 3 to base 9.  Use it to convert 2110201102220112$$_3$$ to base 9.
