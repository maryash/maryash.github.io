Consider the numbers $$M = 306_{10}$$ and $$N = 238_{10}$$. Convert them to base $$2$$ first,
then perform $$M-N$$ using the $$(r-1)'s$$ complement representation subtraction algorithm for following values. Finally, convert the result to base $$16$$.  




2
Find $$(r-1)'s$$ complement of the number $$2602_8$$. 
  
  


3 
Knowing that we have the equality:  
$$1C3_{x-2} = 2A_{16}$$  
determine the value of $$x$$.  
Hint: start by converting both sides to base 10.
