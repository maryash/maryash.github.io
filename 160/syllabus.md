**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
The course will include topics such as: binary number representations, Boolean algebras, logic gates, simplification of Boolean functions, NAND and NOR, and other implementations, combinational logic, flip-flops, shifting, and counters. This course’s objectives will work towards fulfilling of the articles 1:A, B; 2:B; 3:A, C, D of the Computer Science Department’s learning goals.  
  
**OTHER POLICIES**
You are expected to ATTEND CLASS REGULARLY and NOT TO COME IN LATE, as you are RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MATERIAL COVERED, whether in
this syllabus or not, or ANNOUNCEMENT MADE DURING ANY OF THE CLASSES. I will post class notes. However you will have to attend all lectures to understand the material! Hmework/projects will be required and collected every class meeting.  There will be unannounced quizzes.  In-class participation may count as a “needed” bonus to the final grade.  
The whole material will be divided (by the date of the Test 1) into two parts.  
  
**PREREQUISITES**  
CSCI 127 and CSCI 150.  

**MAIN COURSE WEBPAGE**  
[maryash.github.io/160/index.html](https://maryash.github.io/160/index.html)  
Please check this page regularly for announcements, updates, lecture notes and schedule. All course materials will be gradually posted here. 
  
**COURSE FINAL GRADE COMPOSITION**  
12% for homeworks, 18% quizzes, 35% the midterm, and 35% the final exam. 
  
**QUESTIONS**  
Ask as many as you need during lecture -- you will be doing a service to everyone:  if you have a question, it is likely that other students have the same question, but hesitate to ask it.      

**BLACKBOARD COLLABORATE**  
We will use BlackBoard Collaborate synchronousely for all **lectures** as well as all **lab sessions for help with projects**.  We will also use BlackBoard for all exams.  Make sure that you have configured BlackBoard to use your preferred email address (your Hunter email address, by default).  You must regularly check my announcements on BlackBoard and your Hunter email. This is how you will receive important course-related communication.  
  
**IMPORTANT:** Students who participate in this class with their camera on or use a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who are unable to attend live. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.

**GRADESCOPE**  
You will submit all projects electronically through Gradescope. You will see your grades on Gradescope as well. An invite email was sent to you before the first lecture. If you have not received it, ask to send you another one: you will need to email him or her your full name, EMPLID, and a working email address. 

**SYLLABUS COMPLIANCE**  
Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the grading policy, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change. In particular, the course schedule on the webpage, including topics, readings and project assignments, is subject to change. Any changes will be announced in class and on the course webpage. Be sure to check for updates online regularly.  

**POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**  
There are plenty of resources and examples available that you may consult and understand to incorporate those ideas into your projects. However, you must ultimately write your programs yourself. You are actively encouraged to discuss ideas with one other. However, unless otherwise stated, you may not give code to or receive code from anyone else. If you are uncertain about the appropriateness of a particular case, you may ask.  
  
In this course, special attention is given to contract cheating, where students have work completed on their behalf that is then submitted for academic credit. All submitted projects will be thoroughly checked for authenticity/originality with screening software in order to prevent contract cheating. Please read more information on Contract cheating from http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_cheating.  
  
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according
to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.  

**ADA COMPLIANCE**   
In compliance with the ADA and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Hunter College is committed to ensuring educational access and accommodations for all its registered students.

**PROGRAMMING PROJECTS**  
I hope you will enjoy the programming projects! There will be seven programming projects.  You will have a week to complete each project. Every program must comply with the [Programming Guidelines](programming_guidelines.html){:target="_blank"}. You **must read** this document, it contains guidelines about submission, lateness, plagiarism, grading and logging into your Linux accounts.

**SOFTWARE**  
This course it taught in Linux and your programs must be able to run on a Linux platform. [ On campus, you may use the 1001C and 1001B labs to do your work for this course. ] The standard Linux/Unix/Mac OS C++ compiler is g++. If you wish to use a home computer, you can use any version of Linux. We recommend [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com) -- it the one used by Gradescope.  Or use a Mac.  Macs have Unix command line and g++.  You could also use a Linux environment included with most recent versions of Windows.  Check out this excellent tutorial: [okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf
](https://okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf) or just google it. We have had problems in the past with students programming in a native Windows environment at home, and their programs don’t work in the Linux labs and might be incompatible with Gradescope.
