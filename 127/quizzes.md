QUIZZES
---

At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory exercises.

*   As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
*   All quizzes must be taken during class time, and **there are no make-up quizzes.** Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
*   All computer-based quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and C++ programming environment.
*   For the paper-based quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.).
*   If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.

### Using Blackboard

This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for in-class quizzes and posting grades. Blackboard should be accessible through your CUNY First account (see Hunter [ICIT Blackboard page](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/blackboard-information-page) for directions on using the system and how to get help).

### Calendar

As the name suggests, in-class quizzes **must** be taken in-class. If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
