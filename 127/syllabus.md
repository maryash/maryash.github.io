## CSCI 127 Syllabus
---
#### General Information

**Description:** _3 hours, 3 credits:_ This course presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on problem-solving and computational thinking through 'coding': computer programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for intended Majors.

***Expectations:*** Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

***Honor Code:*** You are encouraged to work together on the overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity):

> Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.

All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

***Homework:*** Programming exercises are posted on the class website, usually three weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab. Note that as the semester progresses, the programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to complete. To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style. Programs are submitted via [gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com). You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores). ***No late homework is accepted.***

***Lecture Participation:*** At every lecture, there will be a lecture slip to be submitted, either electronically or on paper. Completed lecture slips are given full credit. Turning in lecture slips will only help your grade. There are no make-up lecture slips. Instead, if you miss a lecture slip, your grade on the final exam will replace that grade.

***In-Class Quizzes:*** At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory exercises.

*   As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
*   All quizzes must be taken during class time, and **there are no make-up quizzes.** Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
*   Quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and C++ programming environment.
*   If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
*   As suggested by the name, only in-class quizzes taken in class. Quizzes taken outside of class will be sanctioned with a grade of 0 and reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Repeated quizzes taken outside of class will result in a failing grade as well as sanctions, as outlined in the Academic Integrity Policy.

***Final Exam:*** The final exam is required. It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course. Sample and past exams will be available on the course webpage.

#### Grading Policy

***Grades:*** The grading for the course will be based on:

*   Problem Sets: 30%
*   Quizzes: up to 28%
*   Participation (Lecture Slips): up to 7%
*   Final Exam: 35% (up to 70% if you do better on the final exam than on quizzes and lecture slips).

***You must take and pass the final to pass the course.***

#### Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities

***Textbook & Readings:*** The following free on-line book is required for the course:

*   [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Python 3)](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) (free on-line textbook).

Additional readings and tutorials are available on the course webpage.

***Technology:*** This course uses multiple software tools and languages. All are available on the lab computers.

*   Python: a programming language that is freely available across multiple platforms. See [Lab 1](lab_01.html) for details on obtaining it for your home computer.
*   Unix: an operating system that underlies Ubuntu Linux (what the lab computers run) as well as MacIntosh OSX.
*   Blackboard: the learning management system used throughout CUNY. Accounts are provided automatically to all enrolled students. In this course, in-class quizzes will be given via Blackboard.
*   Gradescope: an automatic grading program from UC Berkeley. All programming assignments will be submitted to gradescope. An email with access information will be sent to your email of record on Blackboard two days before the semester starts.
*   Github: a freely available site for hosting and collaborating, particularly for programming.
*   C++: a programming language that is freely available. We will use it in the last third of the course. Information on downloading it for your computer will be available in Lab 12.

***Computer Access:*** Part of this course will use university computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.

***Tutoring:*** The CSci 127 course has a dedicated laboratory, 1001E North, and a staff of undergraduate teaching assistants to provide tutoring and assistance with the course.  

***Lab and Tutor Hours:***  
There is a dedicated computer laboratory for this course at HUNTER NORTH 1001E.  It is the same lab where you have your recitation sessions!  It is staffed with tutors, who are there to help you.  Please take advantage of it.  
MONDAYS and WEDNESDAYS from 9:30am to 6:00pm  
TUESDAYS and THURSDAYS from 3:00PM to 6:00PM  

>***Accommodating Disabilities:*** In compliance with the American Disability Act of 1990 (ADA) and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Hunter College is committed to ensuring educational parity and accommodations for all students with documented disabilities and/or medical conditions. It is recommended that all students with documented disabilities (Emotional, Medical, Physical, and/or Learning) consult the Office of AccessABILITY, located in Room E1214B, to secure necessary academic accommodations. For further information and assistance, please call: (212) 772- 4857 or (212) 650-3230.

>***Hunter College Policy on Sexual Misconduct:*** In compliance with the CUNY Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Hunter College reaffirms the prohibition of any sexual misconduct, which includes sexual violence, sexual harassment, and gender-based harassment retaliation against students, employees, or visitors, as well as certain intimate relationships. Students who have experienced any form of sexual violence on or off campus (including CUNY-sponsored trips and events) are entitled to the rights outlined in the Bill of Rights for Hunter College.
>*   Sexual Violence: Students are strongly encouraged to immediately report the incident by calling 911, contacting NYPD Special Victims Division Hotline (646-610-7272) or their local police precinct, or contacting the College's Public Safety Office (212-772-4444).
>*   All Other Forms of Sexual Misconduct: Students are also encouraged to contact the College's Title IX Campus Coordinator, Dean John Rose (jtrose@hunter.cuny.edu or 212-650-3262) or Colleen Barry (colleen.barry@hunter.cuny.edu or 212-772-4534) and seek complimentary services through the Counseling and Wellness Services Office, Hunter East 1123.
