COURSE OBJECTIVES  
This course is the second in a three-course series, and it is a major stepping-stone in your software development journey. The primary focus of this course is the design and analysis of algorithms and abstract data types. To this end it introduces elementary data structures with related algorithms and their use in problem solving. The course also covers core computer science concepts such as abstraction, algorithm complexity, performance analysis and the tradeoffs between running time, storage size, clarity and extensibility that are at the core of software design. As a sequel to CSCI 135 it will also enhance your programming skills in C++ and Object Oriented Programming by introducing new tools such as Templates, Inheritance, Polymorphism, extend your understanding of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.  
  
PREREQUISITES  
CSCI 135 and CSCI 150.  

MAIN COURSE WEBPAGE  
[maryash.github.io/235/2020_summer.html](https://maryash.github.io/235/2020_summer.html)  
Please check this page regularly for announcements, updates, lecture notes and schedule. All course materials will be gradually posted here. 
  
BLACKBOARD  
We will use BlackBoard Collaborate synchronousely for all lectures.  You must also regularly check my announcements on BlackBoard and your Hunter email. This is how you will receive important course-related communications.  
  
PROGRAMMING PROJECTS  
I hope you will enjoy the programming projects! There will be six programming projects; the lowest project grade will be dropped. Every program must comply with the Programming Guidelines provided in a separate document. You **must read** this document, it contains guidelines about submission, lateness, plagiarism, grading and logging into your Linux accounts.  
  
TUTORING  
There are dedicated computer lab for this course: HUNTER NORTH 1001B. It is staffed with tutors, who are there to help you. Please take advantage of them. You can ask for help with labs, projects, and general course material Monday through Friday from 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

QUESTIONS  
Ask many in lecture! Outside of lecture go to the tutoring labs. The department hired additional tutors especially for students taking this course. Email the instructor of your recitation section with any programming questions that the tutors cannot answer. The beginning of each recitation is also devoted to answering questions. All emails to instructors must start with your full name, day and time of your recitation section, and name of your recitation instructor. 

GRADESCOPE  
You will submit all labs, homeworks, quizzes, and projects electronically through Gradescope. You will see your grades (including exam grades) on Gradescope as well. An invite email was sent to you before the first lecture. If you have not received it, ask your recitation instructor to send you another one right away: you will need to email him or her your full name, EMPLID, and a working email address. 

BLACKBOARD  
Make sure that you have configured BlackBoard to use your preferred email address (your Hunter email address, by default), since you are responsible for any email I might send there.

SOFTWARE  
This course it taught in Linux and your programs must be able to run on a Linux platform. On campus, you may use the 1001C and 1001B labs to do your work for this course. The standard Linux/Unix/Mac OS C++ compiler is g++. If you wish to use a home computer, you can use a Mac.  Macs have Unix command line and g++.  You can install [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com). If you want a Linux environment on Windows without installing Linux, follow this excellent tutorial: [okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf
](https://okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf
). We have had problems in the past with students programming in a native Windows environment at home, and their programs don’t work in the Linux labs and might be incompatible with Gradescope.

GRADING  
5% mid-lecture quizzes, 6% homeworks, 7% for each of the three projects (this may not seem like a lot, but beware that many exam questions will be based directly on homeworks and projects), 17% each of two midterm exams, and 34% final exam.  If you do better on the final exam, your final exam grade may also replace your quiz and homework grades, as well as the lowest of the three project scores.  However, if you do not pass the final exam, you cannot pass the course.  

LATE AND MAKE UP POLICY  
Ample time will be given to complete labs and projects.  However, because of the logistics of running a large lecture course, there will be no late project or lab submissions. 

LEARNING OUTCOMES  
Show a deep practical knowledge of one widely used programming language.
Implement a complete correct program utilizing all basic C++ concepts.
Analyze and solve a non-trivial problem by designing and implementing a C++ program on your own. 
Apply principles of design and analysis in creating substantial programs and projects of realistic scope. 

CLASS EXPECTATIONS  
• From the beginning, you will be expected to work independently outside of the lectures. Get started right away – especially if you are going to install your own compiler and/or operating system. The first programming project is assigned during the first week.
• Absorbing the material and doing the assignments may be challenging. In order to grasp software development concepts one must sit in front of a computer many hours a week actually writing and debugging programs outside of class time. When it comes to programming, the learning is in the doing. There is no substitute for trying and failing, trying and failing, until you finally get your program up and running correctly.  Get ample help from the tutors.  
• Midterm and final exams are largely based on the labs, programming projects, and homeworks. It is essential that you complete them on time. 

SYLLABUS COMPLIANCE  
Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the grading policy, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change. In particular, the course schedule on the webpage, including topics, readings and project assignments, is subject to change. Any changes will be announced in class and on the course webpage. Be sure to check for updates online regularly.  

HUNTER COLLEGE POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  
We take academic honesty very seriously, and any violation results in sanctions in accordance with Hunter College procedure.
