**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
This course is the second in a three-course series, and it is a major stepping-stone in your software development journey. The primary focus of this course is the design and analysis of algorithms and abstract data types. To this end it introduces elementary data structures with related algorithms and their use in problem solving. The course also covers core computer science concepts such as abstraction, algorithm complexity, performance analysis and the tradeoffs between running time, storage size, clarity and extensibility that are at the core of software design. As a sequel to CSCI 135 it will also enhance your programming skills in C++ and Object Oriented Programming by introducing new tools such as Templates, Inheritance, Polymorphism, extend your understanding of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.  
  
**PREREQUISITES**  
CSCI 135 and CSCI 150.  

**MAIN COURSE WEBPAGE**  
[maryash.github.io/235/2020_summer.html](https://maryash.github.io/235/index.html)  
Please check this page regularly for announcements, updates, lecture notes and schedule. All course materials will be gradually posted here. 
  
**PROGRAMMING PROJECTS**  
I hope you will enjoy the programming projects! There will be six programming projects.  You will have a week will to complete each project. Every program must comply with the [Programming Guidelines](programming_guidelines.html){:target="_blank"}. You **must read** this document, it contains guidelines about submission, lateness, plagiarism, grading and logging into your Linux accounts.  
  
**COURSE FINAL GRADE COMPOSITION**  
13% for each of the six projects (together they are the most important part of your grade), 6% lecture activities, and 16% final exam. 
  
**QUESTIONS**  
Ask as many as you need during lecture!  You may get additional help with your project from our tutor.  

**BLACKBOARD**  
We will use BlackBoard Collaborate synchronousely for all **lectures** as well as **help with projects**.  We will also use a BlackBoard discussion forum.  Make sure that you have configured BlackBoard to use your preferred email address (your Hunter email address, by default).  You must regularly check my announcements on BlackBoard and your Hunter email. This is how you will receive important course-related communication.  
  
**GRADESCOPE**  
You will submit all projects electronically through Gradescope. You will see your grades (including exam grades) on Gradescope as well. An invite email was sent to you before the first lecture. If you have not received it, ask to send you another one: you will need to email him or her your full name, EMPLID, and a working email address. 

**SOFTWARE**  
This course it taught in Linux and your programs must be able to run on a Linux platform. <!--- On campus, you may use the 1001C and 1001B labs to do your work for this course. ---> The standard Linux/Unix/Mac OS C++ compiler is g++. If you wish to use a home computer, you can use a Linux. You can also install [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com).  Or use a Mac.  Macs have Unix command line and g++.  You could also use a Linux environment included with most recent versions of Windows.  Follow this excellent tutorial: [okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf
](https://okunhardt.github.io/documents/Installing_WSL.pdf
). We have had problems in the past with students programming in a native Windows environment at home, and their programs don’t work in the Linux labs and might be incompatible with Gradescope.  

**SYLLABUS COMPLIANCE**  
Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the grading policy, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change. In particular, the course schedule on the webpage, including topics, readings and project assignments, is subject to change. Any changes will be announced in class and on the course webpage. Be sure to check for updates online regularly.  

**POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**  
There are plenty of resources and examples available that you may consult and understand to incorporate those ideas into your projects. However, you must ultimately write your programs yourself. You are actively encouraged to discuss ideas with one other. However, unless otherwise stated, you may not give code to or receive code from anyone else. If you are uncertain about the appropriateness of a particular case, you may ask.  
  
In this course, special attention is given to contract cheating, where students have work completed on their behalf that is then submitted for academic credit. All submitted projects will be thoroughly checked for authenticity/originality with screening software in order to prevent contract cheating. Please read more information on Contract cheating from http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_cheating.  
  
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according
to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.  

**ADA COMPLIANCE**   
In compliance with the ADA and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Hunter College is committed to ensuring educational access and accommodations for all its registered students. Hunter College’s students with disabilities and medical conditions are encouraged to register with the Office of AccessABILITY for assistance and accommodation. For information and appointment contact the Office of AccessABILITY located in Room E1214 or call (212) 772-4857 /or VRS (646) 755-3129.
