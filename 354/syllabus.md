**[CSCI 39500 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DATABASE DESIGN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HUNTER COLLEGE &nbsp; CUNY](index.html)** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [**SYLLABUS**](syllabus.html){:target="_blank"} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [**GRADESCOPE**](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/ "Entry Code "){:target="_blank"}  
  
**Description** &nbsp; This course in practical database design covers essential skills needed to conceptualize, model, and implement robust and effective database systems that meet the real-world business scenarios.  You will learn to visually represent data organization, model entity-relationships, normalize schemas, minimize redundancy, and ensure data integrity.  With hands-on projects on organizing data (creating tables, defining constraints) and manipulating data (querying, updating).  Informed by real world scenarios, this course will teach you to analyze business requirements and to crystalize them into optimum database schemas.
  
**Prerequisites** &nbsp; CSCI 22700 or CSCI 23500

**Learning Outcomes**  
1. Be able to design and implement a relational database schema design of realistic complexity normalized to 3NF.  
1. Be able to implement the database in a RDBMS.  
1. Be able to manipulate a relational database using a query language.  
1. Be able to integrate a relational database into a software application, including one with a three-tier server architecture.

**Required Supplies** &nbsp; You will write and draw all homeworks, tests, and exams with pen on paper in the exact maner that I specify. You will photo-scan and submit all to gradescope for semi-automated grading. Maximum consistency being essential, you MUST buy this [PARTICULAR GRID PAPER](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZKYYS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A36N3VFG4OZIHD){:target="_blank"} and these [0.7mm BLACK **Pilot FriXion** pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QYH52C/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER){:target="_blank"} - both very inexpensive!  I will not allow any other paper or pens/pencils.  You MUST also use this particular free scanner app: [ 🍏 ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/scanner-app-genius-scan/id377672876){:target="_blank"} / [ 🤖 ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
  
**Expectations** Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.
  
**Technology** &nbsp; This course uses multiple software tools and languages:    
*Python* a programming language that is freely available across multiple platforms.   
*SQLite* a free database.  
*BrightSpace* the learning management system used throughout CUNY. Accounts are provided automatically to all enrolled students.  
*Gradescope*  All assignments will be submitted to Gradescope. Weekly tets, exams and homeworks will be on paper submited as images, graded, and returned via Gradescope. An email with access information will be sent to your email of record on Blackboard two days before the semester starts.  
*Github* a freely available site for hosting and collaborating, particularly for programming.
  
**Final Grade** 
Home Work Assignments: 20% (you may be called to explain any homework assignment solution in detail)
Lab Tests: 40%  
Final Exam: 20%  
Project: 20%
You will write/draw all homeworks, tests, and exams with pen on paper in the exact manner that I demand; quality of presentation of your work is a large part of the grade for any assignment.  
    
**Expectations** &nbsp; Attendance of every lecture and every lab is mandatory.  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.  You are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.  
  
**Course Format**  
This course will be taught synchronousely on line. Each week the course meets    
1.5 hours of lecture  
1.5 hours of supervized lab   
  
**Lecture Participation** &nbsp; Active participation in the lecture is an integral part of the learning experience.  
  
**Weekly Tests** &nbsp; Every week, there will be a test on the lecture notes, reading, labs, and assignments.
As the semester progresses, tests will include review questions as well as short exercises based on the homework. Tests are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and the first pass of many programming job interviews. 
For the tests, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc. 
There are no make-up tets. 
  
**Weekly Lab** &nbsp; Each week, you are expected to work through the associated Lab, which will involve a graded test and a code review.  
  
**Reviews of Lab Assignments** &nbsp; Every week there will be an in-person review of your work on labs assignments.  
There are no make-up reviews. 
  
**Homework** &nbsp; Programming exercises reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab. Note that as the semester progresses, the programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to complete. You should plan to spend at least 3 hours per week on design and programming exercises. To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style and precisely follow all style and naming conventions imposed by the instructor – and be submitted by due date.  
  
**Final Project** &nbsp; A 20 point comprehensive final project will demonstrate your mastery of and proficiency in all topics and materials covered in the course.  It will be framed as a three-tier relational database solution running on a server with a web front end, which will fully implement business logic of a hypothetical company or product.  
  
**Computer Access** &nbsp; University computer laboratories are available for this course in 1001B HN. These machines are for all students enrolled in computer science at Hunter College.  Given the limited number (26 machines), work on those computers must be related to this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term.
