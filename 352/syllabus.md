#CSCI 35200: DATABASE DESIGN**
Hunter College, City University of New York
##General Information**
This is a practical database design course.  It covers essential skills needed to conceptualize, model, and implement robust and effective database systems that meet the real-world business scenarios.  You will learn to conceptually represent data organization, model entity-relationships, normalize schemas, minimize redundancy, and ensure data integrity.  With hands-on projects on organizing data (creating tables, defining constraints) and manipulating data (querying, updating).  Informed by real world scenarios, this course will teach you to analyze business requirements and to crystalize them into optimum database schemas.
##Prerequisite CSCI 22700 or CSCI 23500
##Learning Outcomes
The successful student the end of the course should:  
Be able to design and implement a relational database schema design of realistic complexity that normalized to 3NF.  
Be able to implement the database in a RDBMS.  
Be able to manipulate a relational database using a query language.  
Be able to integrate a relational database into a software application, including one with a three-tier server architecture.
##Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities
**Textbook & Readings** The book or PDF required for the course:  
Widom, Ullman et al "A First Course in Database Systems" 3rd Edition OR "Database Systems - The Complete Book" 2nd Edition (selected chapters)  
Additional readings and tutorials are available on the course webpage.  
Technology This course uses multiple software tools and languages.  
**Python** a programming language that is freely available across multiple platforms.   
**SQLite** a free database.  
**BrightSpace** the learning management system used throughout CUNY. Accounts are provided automatically to all enrolled students.  
**Gradescope** an automatic grading program from UC Berkeley. All programming assignments will be submitted to Gradescope. Lecture quizzes will be on paper, but graded and returned via Gradescope. An email with access information will be sent to your email of record on Blackboard two days before the semester starts.  
**Github** a freely available site for hosting and collaborating, particularly for programming.
##Grades The grading for the course will be based on:
Programming Assignments: 20%  
Lab Quizzes:  20% (the average of the highest 10 quiz scores)  
Design and Code Reviews: 20% (the average of the highest 10 code review scores)  
Participation: 10% (the average of the highest 10 lecture slip scores)  
Final Project: 30%
##Expectations:
Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the online Labs, the textbook and other assigned reading.  
Honor Code: You are encouraged to work together on the overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You are responsible for knowing and following **Hunter College's Academic Integrity Policy:**  
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.  
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.
##Course Format
This course may be taught fully in person, fully online, or in hybrid mode. Each week the course meets    
1.5 hours of lecture  
1.5 hours of Supervized Lab and Code Reviews
##Lecture Participation
Active participation in the lecture is an integral part of the learning experience.
##Quizzes
Every week, there will be a quiz on the lecture notes, reading, labs, and assignments.
As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as well as short programming exercises based on the homework. 
Quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and the first pass of many programming job interviews). 
For the quizzes, you may not use any notes, books, or any computer device (laptop, phone, calculator, smart watch, etc.). 
There are no make-up quizzes. Instead, the 4 lowest quiz scores (of 14 quizzes) are dropped when computing the final grade.
##Design and Code Reviews
Every week, there will be an in-person code review on the recently submitted labs and assignments.  
Design and Code reviews are on paper or  whiteboard (echoing the style of many programming job interviews).  
There are no make-up code reviews. Instead, the 4 lowest code review scores (of 14 code reviews) are dropped when computing the final grade.
##Weekly Lab / Recitation Section
Each week, you are expected to work through the associated Lab, which will involve a code review.
##Homework
Programming exercises are posted on the class website. They reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab. Note that as the semester progresses, the programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to complete. You should plan to spend at least 3 hours per week on design and programming exercises. To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style (i.e. follow the Python Style Guide PEP-8) and precisely follow all style and naming conventions imposed by the instructor – and be submitted by due date.  
You can miss up to 4 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores). No late homework is accepted.
##Final Project
A comprehensive final project is required.  It will demonstrate your mastery of and proficiency in all topics and materials covered in the course.  It will be framed as a three-tier relational database solution running on a server with a web front end, which will fully implement business logic of a hypothetical company or product.  Your Final Project must receive 60 points or more to pass the course.
##Computer Access
University computer laboratories are available for this course in 1001B HN. These machines are for all students enrolled in computer science at Hunter College.  Given the limited number (26 machines), work on those computers must be related to this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term.
##Tutoring
The college provides drop-in tutoring and assistance for courses via Skirball Science Learning Center.  Additional tutoring will be available in the computer science department (10th Floor Hunter North).  
We also provide discussion board and email help.  More information is available on the course site on Blackboard.
##Policy on Bullying
Bullying, cyberbullying, online hate, intimidation, threats, harassment, and pressure to share schoolwork are all forms of violence. CUNY holds a zero tolerance stance towards all such acts. The University is committed to prevention of any form of bullying, will respond promptly to threats and/or acts, and will protect victims of bullying from retaliation.  As a criminal matter, the New York Attorney General defines cyberbullying as the use of email, websites, instant messaging, chat rooms, text messaging and digital cameras to antagonize and intimidate others. Disrupting a teleconferencing platform (such as Zoom/Skype/Blackboard Collaborate Ultra) is a federal crime.
